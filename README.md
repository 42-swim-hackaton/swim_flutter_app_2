# Swim App - Hackathon Contribution

Team Members: Aline, Edith and Melissa.

We participated in the Swim-42 Hackathon, which consisted in developing a mobile app using Flutter and Dart, as usually Hackathons last around 24 to 48 hours and we knew it was short time for us to deliver a good final product hehe üòÖ so we 3 wanted to hone our skills developing our part.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is to practice.


## Structure

During the hackathon weekend our mobile app' structure (directory wise) was a little crazy... but following a medium article, here it is our new structure lib/:

- index.dart: file that export all the other dart files, this one must be imported(called) in files that have dependecies.
- images: Folder to hold the images/assets used in the project.
- screens: This folder contains the screens which will be configured in the routes in the main.dart file.
   In this case, will be the screens for: 'Pool chat', 'Group Chat', '1 to 1 Chat'.  
- models: models with information (usually from database).
   In this case, we will work with sample data.  
- utilities: All the common items goes in here, including resources for the README file.

## Themes

Setting themes and working with them is so much easy, we'd defined the mobile app's colors and fonts in the **app_theme** file for Light and Dark Theme, here in a example of the presets:

<img alt="Light Theme" src="https://github.com/42-swim-hackaton/swim_flutter_app/blob/master/lib/utilities/resources/Light-Theme.png" width="210px" HSPACE="42"/><img alt="Dark Theme" src="https://github.com/42-swim-hackaton/swim_flutter_app/blob/master/lib/utilities/resources/Dark-Theme.png" width="210px" HSPACE="42"/>

e.g.

‚≠êÔ∏è In order to set color, do this:

```
  static Color _lightPrimaryVariantColor = Color(0xFF15A8A4);

  static final ThemeData lightTheme = ThemeData(
    scaffoldBackgroundColor: _lightPrimaryColor,
    appBarTheme: AppBarTheme(
      color: _lightPrimaryVariantColor,
      iconTheme: IconThemeData(
        color: _lightOnPrimaryColor,
      ),
    ),
  );
```
   You must use it this way:
```
   return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(
          'Navigate Life',
          style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline,
          ),
        ),
      ),
```
   This line -> 
   ```
   style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline,
   ```

‚≠êÔ∏è If you change the value for **_lightPrimaryVariantColor**, the AppBar will change automatically the background color :)
